# AOC-2023
Advent of Code 2023

The source folder for each day contains my solution to part 1 and my solution to part 2, aswell as the input and any other classes I used for that day.
The part 1 and part 2 classes contain alot of duplicate code. This was to keep my solutions seperate while still using mostly the same code.
